Current tax laws have which of the following effects?
  Favor dividends because there are no capital gains taxes on dividends.

Correct!
  Favor capital gains because the tax does not have to be paid until the stock is sold. 
  Do not favor dividends or capital gains for most people because different people are in different tax brackets.

Which of the following statements is correct?
  For the most part, our federal tax rates are progressive, because higher incomes are taxed at higher average rates. 
  Bonds issued by a municipality such as the city of Miami would carry a lower interest rate than bonds with the same risk and maturity issued by a private corporation such as Florida Power & Light.
  Our federal tax laws tend to encourage corporations to finance with debt rather than with equity securities. 
  Our federal tax laws encourage the managers of corporations with surplus cash to invest it in stocks rather than in bonds. However, other factors may offset tax considerations.

You Answered
  Given the multi-owner nature of most large corporations, agency costs associated with perquisite consumption are not really a problem. 
  Managers may operate in the stockholders' best interests, but they may also operate in their own personal best interests. As long as managers stay within the law, there simply are not any effective controls that stockholders can implement to control managerial decision making.
Correct Answer
  Shareholder agency costs include the opportunity costs associated with constraining managerial freedom but do not include managerial salaries. 
  An agency relationship exists when one or more persons hire another person to perform some service but withhold decision-making authority from that person.
  All of these statements are false.

Question 9

Which of the following actions is consistent with social responsibility but is necessarily inconsistent with stockholder wealth maximization?
  Investing in a smokestack "scrubber" to reduce the firm's air pollution as mandated by law.
  Voluntarily installing expensive machinery to treat effluent discharge which currently is being dumped into a river where it is ruining the drinking water of the community where the plant is located. 
  Investing in a smokestack filter to reduce sulphur-dioxide emissions in order to reduce the current tax being levied on the firm by the state for its pollution. 
  Making a large corporate donation to the local community in order to fund a recreation complex that will be used by the community and the firm's employees.
Correct!
  Each of these actions is consistent with social responsibility and none is necessarily inconsistent with stockholder wealth maximization. 
 
Question 10
1 / 1 pts
Which of the following statements is correct?
Correct!
  The ability of firms to engage in socially beneficial projects that involve voluntary costs is constrained by competition and the need of firms to attract capital at low cost. 
  The actions that maximize a firm's stock price are inconsistent with maximizing social welfare.
  The concepts of social responsibility and ethical responsibility on the part of corporations are completely different and neither is relevant in maximizing stock price. 
  In a competitive market, if a group of firms do not spend resources making social welfare improvements, but another group does, in general, this will not affect the second group's ability to attract capital.
  If government did not mandate socially responsible corporate actions, such as those relating to product safety and fair hiring practices, most firms in competitive markets would still pursue such policies voluntarily. 
 
Question 11
1 / 1 pts
Which of the following statements is correct?
  The corporate bylaws are the set of rules drawn up by the state to enable managers to run the firm in accordance with state laws.
Correct!
  Procedures for electing corporate directors are contained in bylaws while the declaration of the activities that the firm will pursue and the number of directors are included in the corporate charter.
  Procedures which govern changes in the bylaws of the corporation are contained in the corporate charter.
  Although most companies design a charter, only the bylaws are legally required to be filed with the secretary of state in order for a corporation to be in official existence.
 
Question 12
1 / 1 pts
Which of the following statements is correct?
  A hostile takeover is a primary method of transferring ownership interest in a corporation. 
  The corporation is a legal entity created by the state and is a direct extension of the legal status of its owners and managers, that is, the owners and managers are the corporation.
  Unlimited liability and limited life are two key advantages of the corporate form over other forms of business organization. 
Correct!
  In part due to limited liability and ease of ownership transfer, corporations have less trouble raising money in financial markets than other organizational forms. 
  Although stockholders of the corporation are insulated by limited legal liability, the legal status of the corporation does not protect the firm's managers in the same way.
 
Question 13
1 / 1 pts
Which of the following statements is correct?
  In a partnership, liability for other partners' misdeeds includes but is limited to the amount a particular partner has invested in the business.
  Partnerships must be formed according to specific rules which include the filing of a formal written agreement with state authorities where the partnership does business. 
  A fast growth company would be more likely to set up a partnership for its business organization than would a slow-growth company. 
Correct!
  Partnerships have difficulties attracting capital in part because of the other disadvantages of the partnership form of business, including impermanence of the organization. 
  A major disadvantage of a partnership as a form of business organization is the high cost and practical difficulties of its formation. 
 
Question 14
0 / 1 pts
Which of the following statements is correct?
  Other things held constant, it generally is safer to invest money in a proprietorship than in a partnership or a corporation. 
  According to the text, law firms and accounting firms must be organized as proprietorships or partnerships; these businesses do not have the option of incorporating. 
  If you are planning to start a business, which you will run as the sole employee, and if you expect the business to earn $1,000,000 per year before taxes, you can minimize federal income taxes by setting up the business as a corporation. 
You Answered
  According to the text, "agency problems" tend to increase as the percentage of a corporation's stock owned by its managers increases.
Correct Answer
  Maximizing the income statement item "net income" is not the best goal for a corporation whose managers are interested in maximizing the economic welfare of the firm's stockholders.
 
Question 15
0 / 1 pts
Which of the following statements is correct?
  A major disadvantage of a regular partnership or a corporation as a form of business is the fact that they do not offer their owners limited liability, whereas proprietorships do. 
  An advantage of the corporate form for many businesses is the fact that the corporate tax rate always exceeds the personal tax rate, which is the rate at which proprietorships and partnerships are taxed. 
Correct Answer
  There are more partnerships and sole proprietorships than corporations in the U.S., but corporations produce more goods and services than do other forms of business. 
You Answered
  Because corporations enjoy the benefits of limited liability, easy transferability of ownership interest, unlimited life, and favorable tax status relative to the situation for partnerships and proprietorships, most large businesses choose to incorporate. 
  Because lawyers have the incorporation process so automated (e.g., word processors for drawing up the necessary papers), it is less expensive to form a corporation than to form a proprietorship or partnership. 
 
Question 16

Which of the following statements is correct?
  The optimal dividend policy is the one that satisfies the shareholders because they supply the firm's capital.
  The use of debt financing has no effect on earnings per share (EPS) or stock price. 
Correct Answer
  The riskiness of projected EPS depends upon how the firm is financed. 
  Stock price is dependent on the projected EPS and the use of debt but not on the timing of the earnings stream. 
You Answered
  Dividend policy is one aspect of the firm's financial policy that is determined directly by the shareholders.
 
Question 17
1 / 1 pts
Which of the following statements is correct?
  The proper goal of the financial manager should be to maximize the firm's expected cash flow, because this will add the most wealth to each of the individual shareholders (owners) of the firm.
  One way to state the decision framework most useful for carrying out the firm's objective is as follows: "The financial manager should seek that combination of assets, liabilities, and capital which will generate the largest expected projected after-tax income over the relevant time horizon."
  The riskiness inherent in a firm's earnings per share (EPS) depends on the characteristics of the projects the firm selects, which means it depends upon the firm's assets, but EPS does not depend on the manner in which those assets are financed.
  Because large, publicly-owned firms are controlled by their management teams, and typically, ownership is widely dispersed, managers have great freedom in managing the firm. Managers may operate in the stockholders' best interest, but they may also operate in their own personal best interests. As long as managers stay within the law, there simply aren't any effective controls over managerial decisions in such situations.
Correct!
  Agency problems exist between stockholders and managers, and between stockholders and creditors.

Jane Doe, who has substantial personal wealth and income, is considering the possibility of opening a new business in the chemical waste management field. She will be the sole owner. The business will have a relatively high degree of risk, and it is expected that the firm will incur losses for the first few years. However, the prospects for growth and positive future income look good, and Jane expects to realize substantial cash flows from dividends the firm will eventually pay out. Which of the legal forms of business organization would probably best suit her needs?
  Proprietorship, because of ease of entry. 
  Regular corporation, because of the limited liability. 
  Partnership, if she needs additional capital. 
Correct!
  S corporation, to enjoy tax advantages and gain limited liability. 
  In this situation, the various forms of organization seem equally desirable.

Allen Corporation can (1) build a new plant which should generate a before-tax return of 11 percent, or (2) invest the same funds in the preferred stock of FPL, which should provide Allen with a before-tax return of 9%, all in the form of dividends. Assume that Allen's marginal tax rate is 25 percent, and that 70 percent of dividends received are excluded from taxable income. If the plant project is divisible into small increments, and if the two investments are equally risky, what combination of these two possibilities will maximize Allen's effective return on the money invested?
  All in the plant project. 
Correct Answer
  All in FPL preferred stock. 
  60% in the project; 40% in FPL. 
  60% in FPL; 40% in the project. 
  50% in each.

Which of the following statements is correct?
  Due to limited liability, unlimited lives, and ease of ownership transfer, the vast majority of U.S. businesses (in terms of number of businesses) are organized as corporations. 
  Most businesses (by number and total dollar sales) are organized as proprietorships or partnerships because it is easier to set up and operate in one of these forms rather than as a corporation. However, if the business gets very large, it becomes advantageous to convert to a corporation, primarily because corporations have important tax advantages over proprietorships and partnerships. 
Correct Answer
  For a large company (taxable income over $1 million), the tax situation would, generally, favor organization as a partnership or proprietorship, or possibly as an S corporation, rather than as a regular corporation. However, legal considerations related to ownership transfers and liability offset the tax situation, with the result that most business (measured by dollar sales) is conducted by corporations. 
  In the typical situation, a taxpayer's average tax rate is below his or her marginal rate. However, there is an income range within which the average rate exceeds the marginal rate.
